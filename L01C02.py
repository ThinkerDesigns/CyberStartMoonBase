# A variable is just a box with a label on it that can hold something.

# What you put in the box is up to you, but no matter what is inside,
# you can refer to whatever is there by the label on the box.

stuff = "hello"
print(stuff)

stuff = "world!"
print(stuff)

# See? The contents of the variable 'stuff' changed, but we can still
# refer to whatever is there by the label on the box.

# In programming, there are different 'types' of information.
# Learn the ones below.
# String - A string is text. Strings usually have to be wrapped
# in quotation marks.
# Integer - An integer is a whole number. Integers shouldn't have
# quotation marks.
# Float - A float is a number with a decimal point. Floats shouldn't
# have quotation marks.
# Boolean - A boolean value can either be True or False. Boolean
# values shouldn't have quotes.

# Python automatically changes the type of data a variable can hold
# depending on what you try to put into it.
# Sometimes it won't be able to do it automatically, and you'll have
# to convert it yourself.

# CHALLENGE 1: First create a variable called aString and assign it
# the following text: Testing
# Remember the format to assign data to a variable
# ie: variableName = "SomeValue"

# CHALLENGE 2: Next create a variable called anInt and assign it the
# following number: 899
# Remember, you don't need quotes for numbers!

# CHALLENGE 3: Next create a variable called aFloat and assign it the
# following number: 12.55

# CHALLENGE 4: Next create a variable called aBool and assign it the
# value False.

# CHALLENGE 5: Print the variables out in order of the challenge
# number. i.e Challenge 1 first, then Challenge 2, and so on.
