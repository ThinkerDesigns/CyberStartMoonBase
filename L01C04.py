# You can do maths in programming too...

addition = 5 + 5
print(addition) # This will print 10.

multiplication = 5 * 5
print(multiplication) # This will print 25.

division = 5 / 5
print(division) # This will print 1.

# You can also do maths without saving the result in a variable.

print(100 - 42)

# Here are some mathematical operators you should know about:
# Addition [+], as in 5 + 5 = 10
# Subtraction [-], as in 10 - 2 = 8
# Multiplication [*], as in 5 * 5 = 25
# Division [/], as in 10 / 2 = 5
# Power Of [**] as in 2 ** 3 = 8

# CHALLENGE 1: Multiply 80 by 512 and save it to a variable called ch1.

# CHALLENGE 2: Add 1024 to 768 and save it to a variable called ch2.

# CHALLENGE 3: Do 40 minus 100 and save it to a variable called ch3.

# CHALLENGE 4: Divide 33 by 6 and save it to a variable called ch4.

# CHALLENGE 5: Do 2 to the power of 6 and save it to a variable called ch5.

# CHALLENGE 6: Save 0.33 to a variable called ch6_1, and save 5 to a
#              variable called ch6_2. Multiply ch6_1 with ch6_2 and save
#              the result to a variable called ch6.

# CHALLENGE 7: Print out the following variables in order:
#              ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5, ch6
